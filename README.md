##2 : Go to https://app.insighto.ai and create a test account. Explore the product as much as you can and prepare a list of test cases that you’d consider critical for a good user experience
---> 
1. Account Creation and Authentication
Test Case 1: Verify that a user can successfully create an account with valid details (email, username, password).
Test Case 2: Verify the system does not allow account creation with an already-registered email.
Test Case 3: Verify error messages are displayed for invalid input in the email, username, or password fields.
Test Case 4: Verify password strength requirements are enforced during account creation (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
Test Case 5: Verify that a user can successfully log in with correct credentials.
Test Case 6: Verify appropriate error messages for incorrect login credentials (wrong username or password).
Test Case 7: Verify the 'Forgot Password' functionality sends a reset link to the registered email.
Test Case 8: Verify users can reset their password successfully through the reset link.
Test Case 9: Verify that a user remains logged in until they log out or close the session.
Test Case 10: Verify the account logout function works as expected and redirects to the login screen.
2. Dashboard and Navigation
Test Case 11: Verify that the dashboard loads correctly upon login, displaying the main widgets and insights.
Test Case 12: Verify that all main menu items are accessible and correctly routed.
Test Case 13: Verify that buttons and links across the dashboard navigate to the correct sections.
3. User Interface and Usability
Test Case 14: Verify that all UI elements are aligned and properly formatted across different devices and screen resolutions.
Test Case 15: Verify that tooltips and help texts are available for fields or sections where needed.
Test Case 16: Verify that loading indicators or spinners are displayed during data fetching.
Test Case 17: Verify that any error or success messages are clear, concise, and contextually correct.
Test Case 18: Verify that the application maintains consistent styling and design across all pages.
Test Case 19: Verify responsiveness of the interface for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Test Case 20: Verify accessibility features, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
4. Notifications and Alerts
Test Case 21: Verify that users receive real-time notifications for important updates (e.g., new insights, account activity).
Test Case 22: Verify that users can enable or disable notifications through settings.
Test Case 23: Verify that alert messages are appropriately triggered for account-related events, such as login from a new device.
5. Settings and Customization
Test Case 24: Verify that users can change their account settings (e.g., profile info, email).
Test Case 25: Verify users can update their preferences (e.g., language, time zone) and changes are reflected across the platform.
Test Case 26: Verify that users can set data visibility or access permissions for specific data or reports.
Test Case 27: Verify that changes to settings are saved and maintained upon logout/login.
6. Security and Data Privacy
Test Case 28: Verify the platform enforces secure password policies (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
Test Case 29: Verify that sessions time out after a period of inactivity.
Test Case 30: Verify that sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is masked and stored securely.
Test Case 31: Verify that only authenticated users can access restricted areas or data.





###3. Experience with Tools for API Testing:

1) In my experience with API testing, I have primarily used Python's requests library to perform various types of API requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The requests library has proven to be a versatile tool for sending HTTP requests and handling responses effectively, allowing me to test API endpoints for functionality, error handling, and response times.
2) Postman: For manual API testing and validation of endpoints.



####4. Experience with Testing Large Language Models (LLMs):

I don’t have direct experience with testing Large Language Models (LLMs). However, I’m very interested in this area, and I’m familiar with the general challenges and approaches used in testing LLMs.

From my understanding, testing LLMs often includes:
  #Functional Testing for relevance and accuracy in responses.
  #Performance Testing to measure response times, especially under concurrent load.
